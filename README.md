# Flutterdex

This is a Pokédex app created with Flutter.

The data used in this app was provided by [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Getting Started

First of all, you have to have Flutter SDK and a code editor installed to run this project.

If you don't have any of the code editors listed bellow, you can download and install your favourite here:

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [VS Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you don't have Flutter installed, [CLICK HERE](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and you will find all the instructions to install Flutter SDK and the configuration for both code editors.

Once you followed all the instructions you'll have a configured Android or iOS emulator, or maybe your physical device.

Now you just have to clone this repo on your computer,
[download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have it, open a terminal in the location you want to download the project and then run:

`$ git clone https://github.com/Guix98/Flutterdex.git`

Once the project is downlodaded, with your **emulator opened or your devide connected**, you can open the project folder on your code editor and run it, or you can open a terminal inside the project folder and run:

`$ flutter run`

**Congratularions!** you now have a Pokedex in your phone.

## How it works

At the begginning you'll see a Pokémon by default, you can see it's name, types, Pokédex, number, and also all the pokedex entries for this Pokémon.
