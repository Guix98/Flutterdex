# Flutterdex

This is a Pokédex app created with Flutter.

The data used in this app was provided by [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Getting Started

First of all, you have to have Flutter SDK and a code editor installed to run this project.

If you don't have any of the code editors listed bellow, you can download and install your favourite here:

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [VS Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you don't have Flutter installed, [CLICK HERE](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and you will find all the instructions to install Flutter SDK and the configuration for both code editors.

Once you followed all the instructions you'll have a configured Android or iOS emulator, or maybe your physical device.

Now you just have to clone this repo on your computer,
[download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have it, open a terminal in the location you want to download the project and then run:

`$ git clone https://github.com/Guix98/Flutterdex.git`

Once the project is downlodaded, with your **emulator opened or your devide connected**, you can open the project folder on your code editor and run it, or you can open a terminal inside the project folder and run:

`$ flutter run`

**Congratularions!** you now have a Pokedex in your phone.

## How it works

At the begginning you'll see a Pokémon by default, you can see it's name, types, Pokédex, number, and also all the pokedex entries for this Pokémon.

You can scroll to look for any Pokedex entry of this Pokemon, just touch on a Pokédex entry. If you want to close an open entry, just tap anywhere in the screen out of the entry.

Also you can see the Stats of the Pokémon, just click **Stats** button and you'll see something like this:

Just as a pokedex entry, you can close the stats table by swiping it down or taping anywhere else in the screen.
